# High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Engine Simulation

## 1. Introduction
High-Frequency Trading (HFT) involves executing large volumes of trades at extremely high speed (microseconds). This requires specialized engines with:

- Ultra-low latency  
- High throughput (millions of orders/trades per second)  
- Efficient memory and CPU usage  
- Deterministic behavior for consistency  

This project simulates a lightweight HFT engine in **C++17**, focusing on optimized order matching, high-volume handling, and key engine features.

## 2. Problem Statement
The goal is to develop a C++ simulation that:

- Supports **Limit**, **Market**, **IOC**, and **GFD** orders  
- Matches buy and sell orders with minimal latency  
- Handles high-volume order events  
- Maintains order lifecycle (**add**, **cancel**, **replace**)  
- Provides throughput and trade statistics  

> Note: This is a simulation; it does not connect to a live exchange.

## 3. Architecture & Workflow

### 3.1 Components
- **Order Book:** Stores bids and asks in **tick-indexed price levels** using **ring buffers** for constant-time insert/remove.  
- **Order Pool:** Preallocated memory pool for O(1) allocation and cancellation.  
- **Matching Engine:** Core logic executes trades when buy ≥ sell. Supports market sweeps.  
- **Time-In-Force (TIF):**  
  - **GFD:** Good-for-day orders  
  - **IOC:** Immediate-Or-Cancel  
- **Trade Logger:** Records trades with timestamp, price, and quantity.  
- **Workload Generator:** Simulates market activity to stress-test the engine.

### 3.2 Workflow
1. **Order Arrival:** Orders submitted, validated, timestamped.  
2. **Order Matching:** Market orders sweep the book; limit orders match at acceptable prices.  
3. **Trade Execution:** Each match generates a trade event logged in-memory.  
4. **Order Lifecycle:** Supports cancel/replace efficiently using preallocated pool.  
5. **Performance Monitoring:** Measures throughput, latency, and trade stats.

## 4. Real-World Relevance
- Production HFT engines run on bare-metal servers with kernel bypass for low-latency I/O.  
- Symbol sharding and risk checks are standard.  
- Trade logging at nanosecond resolution ensures compliance.  

This simulation models **core matching logic** and can be extended to study system performance.

## 5. Example Use Cases
- **Quant Research:** Benchmark new strategies against synthetic order flows.  
- **Systems Research:** Test data structures (ring buffers vs. linked lists) for latency.  
- **Education/Training:** Demonstrate engine mechanics to developers/students.  
- **Stress Testing:** Simulate high-volume market conditions.

## 6. Key Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Simulation Solution |
|-----------|------------------|
| High allocation latency | Preallocated OrderPool, no dynamic allocation in hot path |
| Cancel/Replace efficiency | Direct clientID → engineID mapping |
| Scalability | Symbol-level sharding (future extension) |
| Trade logging overhead | Lightweight in-memory logging |
| Book overflow | Fixed-size ring buffers per price level |

## 7. Extensions / Future Work
- **O(1) Cancels:** Use position indices for instant removal.  
- **Advanced Orders:** FOK, hidden, iceberg orders.  
- **Concurrency:** Multi-threaded ingestion with lock-free queues.  
- **Network Integration:** Simulate exchange connections via UDP/FIX.  
- **Persistence & Replay:** Binary logs for deterministic backtesting.  
- **Latency Profiling:** High-resolution measurements (p99/p999).

## 8. Conclusion
This simulation provides a **core HFT matching engine** in C++ with low-latency design, preallocation, efficient data structures, and support for common order types. It serves as a foundation for strategy testing, system research, and learning real-world HFT principles.
